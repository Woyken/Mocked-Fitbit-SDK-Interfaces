# What is this?
## Simple interfaces for Fitbit OS development in TypeScript linting support.

All the interfaces are created from [SDK references](https://dev.fitbit.com/build/reference/) by hand in TypeScript. Also checked in Fitbit studio during runtime for js object properties and such, some documentation mismatches were found.

Surely this won't be perfect tool to use, but it does help to speed up the development.

All PR's are welcome!

## Who for? 

* Tried developing in [Fitbit studio](http://studio.fitbit.com/)?
* Got tired of looking at [SDK](https://dev.fitbit.com/build/reference/) and [guides](https://dev.fitbit.com/build/guides/) for what variables can you use and what fields they contain?
* Want to have at least some way of developing for Fitbit offline? 
* Give this a try.

# WARNING!

## Not all exports are set up the same way as they are in Fitbit studio.

Ex. All imports are accessible to both Device and Companion. 

# Set-up

* Clone this repository next to your sources.
* Add these options to *tsconfig.json*:
    ```json
    "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "es5",
        "lib": ["es5"],
        "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    }
    ```
* To build:
    
    Just copy your files to [Fitbit studio](http://studio.fitbit.com/) application.

# Requirements

* Visual Studio Code
* TSLint addon

# Ideas

* VSC extension to upload files to Fitbit studio automatically.

# Known issues

* Interfaces such as 'Element' used as types will not be recognized in Fitbit studio.

    Easy solution for now - Add similar lines to top of the file for each unrecognized type:
    ```typescript
    type Element = any;
    ```
